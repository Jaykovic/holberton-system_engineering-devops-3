# TASKS

0. Set up development with Python mandatory
Letâ€™s serve what you built for AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework on web-01. This task is an exercise in setting up your development environment, which is used for testing and debugging your code before deploying it to production.

Requirements:

- Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01. The checker will connect to your servers.
- Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v2 on your web-01 server.
- Configure the file web_flask/0-hello_route.py to serve its content from the route /airbnb-onepage/ on port 5000.
- Your Flask application object must be named app (This will allow us to run and check your code).

Example:

Window 1:
```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ python3 -m web_flask.0-hello_route
 * Serving Flask app "0-hello_route" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
