# System Engineering Devops

![](logo.jpg)

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those that practice the methodology use different sets of tools—referred to as "toolchains"—rather than a single one.These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process:

1. Coding - code development and review, source code management tools, code merging
2. Building - continuous integration tools, build status
3. Testing - continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks
4. Packaging - artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
5. Releasing - change management, release approvals, release automation
6. Configuring - infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools
7. Monitoring - applications performance monitoring, end-user experience
